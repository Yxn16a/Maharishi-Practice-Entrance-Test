Question 10
A fancy number is a number in the sequence 1,1,5,17,61,... Note the first two fancy numbers
are 1 and any fancy number other than the first two is sum of three times previous one and two times
the one before that. see below
1,
1,
3*1 + 2*1 = 5,
5*3 + 2*1 = 17,
17*3 + 5*2 = 61
Write a function named isFancy that returns 1, if it's integer argument is a Fancy number,
otherwise it returns 0.




Solution:

// fancy Number question
    // a fancy number is a number in which when you add two previous number where the 
    // first number is multiplied by two and another one multiplied by three then the result
    // will be equal to that number
    public  static int fancyNumber(int n){
        int n1=1;
        int n2 =1;
        // n3 is a fancy number  because when you take n1*2 + n2*3 this is equal to 
        // the fancyNumber which is n3
        int n3 = n1*2 + n2*3;
        while(true){
            if(n3==n){
                return 1;
            }
            if(n3>n){
                break;
            }
            n1=n2;
            n2= n3;
            n3 = n1*2 + n2*3;
        }
        return 0;
    }
