Define an array to be sum-safe if none of its elements is equal to the sum of its elements. The array
a = {5, -5, 0} is not sum-safe because the sum of its elements is 0 and a[2] == 0. 
However, the array a = {5, -2, 1} is sum-safe because the sum of its elements is 4 and none of its elements equal 4.
Write a function named isSumSafe that returns 1 if its argument is sum-safe, otherwise it returns 0.

public static int isSumSafe(int[] a) {
        int sum = 0;
        // check if length is zero and then return
        if (a.length == 0) {
            return sum;
        }
        // find sum of element 
        for (int j : a) {
            sum += j;
        }
        // compare each element to sum 
        for (int i : a) {
            if (i == sum) {
                return 0;
            }
        }
        return 1;
    }
